# ShowBoat

A small display to show CalMac ferry status

## Introduction

This is a small project using the Raspberry Pi Pico W to show the service status of Scottish ferries on the Caledonian MacBrayne network. The intention is to create a small and cheap (<Â£10) device that can show at a glance if a particular ferry service is running normally or is disrupted. The hardware design should be cheap and relatively easy for a hobbyist to build. I describe the development process in more detail in [development.md](development.md)

## Hardware

- Raspberry Pi Pico W

- 2 each x green, yellow, orange and red 3mm through-hole LEDs

- 8 x 100-330 Ohm resistors

## Schematic

This is a very simple circuit. The cathodes of the LEDs are connected directly to the four ground pads down each side of the Pico W (marked by square-ended pads), and the anodes are connected via current limiting resistors to GPIO pads. **Just make sure that the short lead and/or flat side of each LED (the cathode) is connected to ground on the Pico W and the long lead (anode) is connected via a resistor to one of the GPIO**.
